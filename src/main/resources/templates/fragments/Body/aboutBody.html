Hosting my own portfolio was never really my thing. Been waiting for a long time to host a site like Cust Qr that potentially helps anyone around the world and has some purpose. Recently was tasked to host a simple website as a Java servlet for a college mini project. While looking for ideas came across a random Qr Code upon buying something using<a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview">UPI</a>. That gave the thought why can't I try to create a customized Qr Code, as all Qr Code's are kind of simple and boring. This idea began as the foundation for the website.</p><p paragraph-type="credits">As for the project itself, much work wasn't needed since professor requested only a simple functioning servlet. Took some help from<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/generating-qr-code-in-java">JavatPoint</a>to create a simple Qr Code generating servlet from the user input. Post submission of project, the website was revamped with new features like background, Qr pattern color modification and logo addition. Did all this without even realizing there are actually Qr customization websites already on the internet. Upon looking over one such website, came to know that even positional markers, Qr pattern can be customized. Since I've already came this further decided not to stop at this and started to work on positional marker's in-depth customization to offer a fairly competitive Qr code generator. Finally came the idea of adding a margin feature and trasparent background option if in-case anyone needs it.</p><p paragraph-type="credits">The site is currently being hosted with simple and modest styling intended only for the time being. Once I get fairly enough time, site will be updated to an even more modern look with additional features planned as well. Stay tuned for CustQr 2.0. Thanks!</p><h2 heading-type="main-heading">Credits</h2><p paragraph-type="credits">Even though every single line of the project's code is executed and tested only by me, can't say the same towards development. As everybody knows, a developer is never truly alone when it comes to development. Since the internet is always there is to back us up when we need help. Lines of code have been taken from fellow developer's contributions all over the internet and have been modified to fit in the needs of this website. Would like to express my gratitude to every single person/entity/website listed below for their contribution.<p></div><div id="dv-aboutcredits"><p paragraph-type="credits"><a href="https://www.denso.com">Denso Wave</a>- Team led by Masahiro Hara from Denso Wave conceptualized, created an awesome technology for labelling and identification which is what we know as Qr Code.</p><p paragraph-type="credits"><a href="https://github.com/zxing/zxing">Google's ZXing Team</a>- The ZXing R&D team that brought the awesome Qr Code technology easily accessible to anyone via a simple package import and a method call.</p><p paragraph-type="credits"><a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a>- Wrench to a mechanic, Stethoscope to a doctor, so is ChatGPT to a developer.
